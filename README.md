## 🚀 Why JobTrac is Different: Beyond Just Tracking

While many tools can help you track job applications, JobTrac is engineered to be your comprehensive command center for the *entire* job search lifecycle—from initial discovery to landing the offer. We don't just help you get organized; we help you get hired.

### **The JobTrac Advantage: It's All About Preparation**

Most job trackers stop at the application. JobTrac is built on the principle that a successful job search is 80% preparation. That's why we've integrated powerful, dedicated modules that other platforms lack:

*   **📚 Integrated Prep Log:** Other tools might let you add a note. JobTrac provides a structured **Prep Log** to systematically track your study sessions, topics covered, and confidence levels. This isn't just a feature; it's a system for turning interview anxiety into mastery.
*   **⭐ Dedicated STAR Story Bank:** Behavioral interviews are make-or-break. Instead of scattering your best career stories in random documents, our **STAR Story Bank** helps you build and refine a powerful arsenal of experiences, ready to be deployed at a moment's notice.

### **A Truly All-in-One Hub**

With JobTrac, you get a seamless, interconnected workflow:
